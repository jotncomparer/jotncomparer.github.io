# This program allows a user to investigate a single player's raid or dungeon information. The data can be divided into
# a single character for one player, all characters for a player, and all character data for everyone in JÃ¶tunn Gang.
# The first section asks the user who they would want to investigate.
# The second section defines the function values for each player and all of their characters.
# The final section looks at the USER value and determines which function to activate.
