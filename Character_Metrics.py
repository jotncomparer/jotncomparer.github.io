# This program needs metricGenerator.py and JOTUNN.py to work properly.

# This program is used to define every player in JÃ¶tunn Gang.
# This program asks the user which player (or all) they wish to investigate several statistics that can be measured.
# This program specifically looks to three areas of interest, character data, triumph data, and metric data
